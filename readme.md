# Plotly Dash

## Overview
Start with the ```0. Plotly.ipynb``` notebook to get a feel of what the plotly graphing library can do. It works together with Dash very well and in most cases will be the main reason you'll want to use Dash.

Next up there are a series of simple scripts that start a Dash app for you. They go from ```1. Layout``` to ```4. Graphs``` and contain a simple 'led-by-example' tutorial on Dash.
